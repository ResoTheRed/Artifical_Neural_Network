This collection of scripts create and Artifical Neural Network that predicts
flowers based on four features.  The number following the 'ANN' title is the 
number of layers that the algorithm uses.  ANN01-ANN07 use backpropagation and 
momentum. ANN03GA uses the genetic algorithm instead of backpropagation.

There isn't a single application that can be run to fully  complete 
any of the tasks, except for ANN03GA.py. Rather, all of the artificial neural 
networks will run one fold.  These files are matlab/octave files and use 
parse_data.py to change each fold.

ANN01.m, ANN03.m, ANN07.m and ANN07 can be run in octave.  These each will run
only 1 fold of the k-fold cross validation.  To change the fold, you must change
the numeric argument in 'parse_data.py' to the desired fold and then re-run 
the desired ANN file again.

ANN03GA.py is all inclusive and runs all 10 folds.  The parameters for the GA 
chan be changed by altering some of the variables in 'genetic_alg' class under
the '__init__' method in 'genetic_alg.py' file. This file requires Numpy and
matplotlib libraries to run.
run: python3 genetic_alg.py

The Additions folder contains program/script files that were used to get the
ressults, but are not part of the overall project.

The Result folder contains all of the graphs generated by running each neural 
network.  It also contains the report.

All other files in this directory are data files used by the scripts.

To recap, we summarize the feed-forward propagation as:
